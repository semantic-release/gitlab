| `verifyConditions` | Verify the presence and the validity of the authentication (set via [environment variables](#environment-variables)).                               |
| `publish`          | Publish a [GitLab release](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/releases/).                                                                      |
| `success`          | Add a comment to each GitLab Issue or Merge Request resolved by the release.                                                                        |
| `fail`             | Open or update a [GitLab Issue](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/) with information about the errors that caused the release to fail. |

## Install

```bash
$ npm install @semantic-release/gitlab -D
```

## Usage

The plugin can be configured in the [**semantic-release** configuration file](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/blob/master/docs/usage/configuration.md#configuration):

```json
{
  "branches": ["main"],
  "plugins": [
    "@semantic-release/commit-analyzer",
    "@semantic-release/release-notes-generator",
    [
      "@semantic-release/gitlab",
      {
        "gitlabUrl": "https://custom.gitlab.com",
        "assets": [
          { "path": "dist/asset.min.css", "label": "CSS distribution" },
          { "path": "dist/asset.min.js", "label": "JS distribution", "target": "generic_package" },
          { "path": "dist/asset.min.js", "label": "v${nextRelease.version}.js" },
          { "url": "https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/README.md" }
        ]
      }
    ]
  ]
}
```

With this example [GitLab releases](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/releases/) will be published to the `https://custom.gitlab.com` instance.

## Configuration

### GitLab authentication

The GitLab authentication configuration is **required** and can be set via
[environment variables](#environment-variables).

Create a [personal access token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html) with the `api` scope and make it available in your CI environment via the `GL_TOKEN` environment variable. If you are using `GL_TOKEN` as the [remote Git repository authentication](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/blob/master/docs/usage/ci-configuration.md#authentication) it must also have the `write_repository` scope.

**Note**: When running with [`dryRun`](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/usage/configuration#dryrun) only `read_repository` scope is required.

### Environment variables

| Variable                       | Description                                                                                |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `GL_TOKEN` or `GITLAB_TOKEN`   | **Required.** The token used to authenticate with GitLab.                                  |
| `GL_URL` or `GITLAB_URL`       | The GitLab endpoint.                                                                       |
| `GL_PREFIX` or `GITLAB_PREFIX` | The GitLab API prefix.                                                                     |
| `HTTP_PROXY` or `HTTPS_PROXY`  | HTTP or HTTPS proxy to use.                                                                |
| `NO_PROXY`                     | Patterns for which the proxy should be ignored. See [details below](#proxy-configuration). |

#### Proxy configuration

The plugin supports passing requests through a proxy server.

You can configure a proxy server via the `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variable: `HTTPS_PROXY=http://proxyurl.com:8080`

If your proxy server requires authentication embed the username and password in the URL: `HTTPS_PROXY=http://user:pwd@proxyurl.com:8080`

If your GitLab instance is exposed via plain HTTP (not recommended!) use `HTTP_PROXY` instead.

If you need to bypass the proxy for some hosts, configure the `NO_PROXY` environment variable: `NO_PROXY=*.host.com, host.com`

### Options

| `type`     | Asset type displayed on the GitLab release. Can be `runbook`, `package`, `image` and `other` (see official documents on [release assets](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/releases/#release-assets)). Supports [Lodash templating](https://lodash.com/docs#template).                                                       | `other`                              |
| `filepath` | A filepath for creating a permalink pointing to the asset (requires GitLab 12.9+, see official documents on [permanent links](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/releases/#permanent-links-to-release-assets)). Ignored if `path` matches more than one file. Supports [Lodash templating](https://lodash.com/docs#template). | -                                    |
| `target`   | Controls where the file is uploaded to. Can be set to `project_upload` for storing the file as [project upload](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/projects.html#upload-a-file) or `generic_package` for storing the file as [generic package](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/generic_packages/).                            | `project_upload`                     |
| `status`   | This is only applied, if `target` is set to `generic_package`. The generic package status. Can be `default` and `hidden` (see official documents on [generic packages](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/generic_packages/)).                                                                                               | `default`                            |

Each entry in the `assets` `Array` is globbed individually. A [glob](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob#glob-primer)
can be a `String` (`"dist/**/*.js"` or `"dist/mylib.js"`) or an `Array` of `String`s that will be globbed together
(`["dist/**", "!**/*.css"]`).

If a directory is configured, all the files under this directory and its children will be included.

**Note**: If a file has a match in `assets` it will be included even if it also has a match in `.gitignore`.

##### assets examples

`'dist/*.js'`: include all the `js` files in the `dist` directory, but not in its sub-directories.

`[['dist', '!**/*.css']]`: include all the files in the `dist` directory and its sub-directories excluding the `css`
files.

`[{path: 'dist/MyLibrary.js', label: 'MyLibrary JS distribution'}, {path: 'dist/MyLibrary.css', label: 'MyLibrary CSS
distribution'}]`: include the `dist/MyLibrary.js` and `dist/MyLibrary.css` files, and label them `MyLibrary JS
distribution` and `MyLibrary CSS distribution` in the GitLab release.

`[['dist/**/*.{js,css}', '!**/*.min.*'], {path: 'build/MyLibrary.zip', label: 'MyLibrary'}]`: include all the `js` and
`css` files in the `dist` directory and its sub-directories excluding the minified version, plus the
`build/MyLibrary.zip` file and label it `MyLibrary` in the GitLab release.

#### successComment

The message for the issue comments is generated with [Lodash template](https://lodash.com/docs#template). The following variables are available:

## Compatibility

The latest version of this plugin is compatible with all currently-supported versions of GitLab, [which is the current major version and previous two major versions](https://about.gitlab.com/support/statement-of-support.html#version-support). This plugin is not guaranteed to work with unsupported versions of GitLab.

### Breaking changes in 14.0

If you are using GitLab.com or have upgraded your self-hosted GitLab instance to 14.0, please use version `>=6.0.7` of this plugin.

#### Why?

In GitLab 14.0, creating a release using the [Tags API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/tags.html) has been removed (see [<span>#</span>290311](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/290311)). This plugin was updated to use the [Releases API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/releases/#create-a-release) instead in https://github.com/semantic-release/gitlab/pull/184, which is available in version `6.0.7` and beyond.
